This project aims to predict real estate housing prices using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging the House Prices dataset from Kaggle, the model employs a Deep Neural Network (DNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to forecast property values. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to achieve accurate price predictions.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training and evaluation.
Feature Engineering: Identifying and creating relevant features to improve model performance.
Model Building: Developing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter adjustments.
Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and performance metrics.
Deployment: Instructions and scripts for deploying the model in a production environment.
Technologies Used:
TensorFlow: For building and training the deep learning model.
Keras: For high-level neural network API and model creation.
Python: For data manipulation, model building, and evaluation
